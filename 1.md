**II. Reactive Power (Q):**
This is the power that oscillates between the source and the reactive components (inductor and capacitor). It is measured in Volt-Amps Reactive (VAR).
*   The formula is $Q = V_{rms} I_{rms} \sin(\theta)$. The angle $\theta$ is the phase difference between voltage and current ($\theta_V - \theta_I = 0^\circ - 73.75^\circ = -73.75^\circ$).
*   $$Q = \left(\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \times 0.989 \times \sin(-73.75^\circ) \approx -6.71 \text{ VAR}$$
The negative sign indicates that the reactive power is **capacitive**. The calculation in the image uses the magnitude of the angle and correctly labels the result as "Capacitive".
